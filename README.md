# 🚀 ReactTypescriptTemplate

A modern, feature-rich template for building robust React applications with TypeScript.

## ✨ Features

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for enhanced code quality and developer experience
- **React**: Efficient, declarative UI development
- **Webpack**: Powerful module bundling
- **Babel**: Next-generation JavaScript compilation
- **ESLint**: Code quality and style checking
- **Prettier**: Opinionated code formatting
- **Husky**: Git hooks for consistent code quality
- **Jest**: Comprehensive testing framework (coming soon)

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (global installation recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ReactTypescriptTemplate.git
cd ReactTypescriptTemplate
npm install
```

### Development

Run the project on a local development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the development server, usually at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Production Build

Create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## 🧰 Available Scripts

- `npm run start`: Starts the development server
- `npm run build`: Creates a production build
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code issues
- `npm run format`: Formats code using Prettier
